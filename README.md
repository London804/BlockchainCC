## Getting Started

This project is very simple to run. Open Terminal and create a local server. I like to use the command 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000'. Go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser. 

To watch Sass open another window in terminal and enter the following command 'sass --watch src/sass/styles.scss:src/style.css'.
